Q1. printEmployee1 is a pass by value function, so the object is copied to the variable 'emp' 
for the duration of the function call. At the end of the function call the variable 'emp' 
goes out of scope causing it to be destroyed.

Q2. printEmployee2 is a pass by referance function which means that the 'emp' variable is the 
same one as 'e2' so no copy is made, and the destructor is not called, since 'e2' is in scope.

Q3. The thing being destroyed in this is the variable 'tmp' declared as part of copy swap, the 
values are the values of the original assignee which have been swapped with the copy of the 
assigner.

Q4. The three things getting destroyed are 'e1', 'e2', and 'e3'. They are being destroyed by 
leaving scope, this is caused by main returning.

Q5. Bob got destroyed during Q3 when you assigned Chris to his variable, 'e1', the variable 
still exists but it now contains information from 'e3' which is Chris.
